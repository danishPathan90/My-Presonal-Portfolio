                    <h4>Advance Js</h4>
                    <p>Advanced JavaScript topics are the concepts and features that go beyond the basics of the language and require more in-depth understanding and practice. Some of the advanced JavaScript topics are:

                        JavaScript Engine: This is the program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into machine instructions. It consists of components such as the parser, the abstract syntax tree, the interpreter, the compiler, and the optimizer.
                        JavaScript Runtime: This is the environment where JavaScript code runs and has access to built-in objects and functions. It includes the JavaScript engine, the web APIs, the event loop, the callback queue, and the job queue.
                        Asynchronous Programming: This is the technique of writing code that can handle multiple tasks at the same time without blocking the main thread. It involves concepts such as callbacks, promises, async/await, generators, and async iterators.
                        Closures and Prototypes: These are the two pillars of JavaScript that enable powerful features such as higher-order functions, object-oriented programming, and functional programming. Closures are functions that can remember their lexical environment, and prototypes are objects that can inherit properties and methods from other objects.
                        Design Patterns: These are reusable solutions to common problems in software design. They help to organize code, improve readability, and enhance maintainability. Some of the common design patterns in JavaScript are module, factory, singleton, observer, decorator, and mediator
